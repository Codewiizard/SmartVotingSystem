# **Voting System DApp**

This project is a decentralized voting system built on Ethereum, utilizing **Solidity** for the smart contract and **React** with **ethers.js** for the frontend. The project allows users to vote for candidates in a transparent and immutable manner.

## **Project Structure**

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Solidity Smart Contract**: A contract that manages voting, candidate management, and vote tallying.
2. **React Frontend**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to connect their wallet, view candidates, and cast votes.

## Project Components

Solidity Contract (VotingSystem.sol)
Owner: Only the contract owner can add candidates to the voting system.
Vote Tracking: Each account can vote only once, and the votes are stored immutably on the blockchain.
Candidate Struct: Stores the candidate's name and vote count.
Key functions:

addCandidate(string memory name): Adds a new candidate (owner only).
vote(uint256 candidateIndex): Allows a user to vote for a specific candidate.
getCandidate(uint256 index): Retrieves a candidate's details.
getCandidateCount(): Returns the total number of candidates.
React Frontend
The frontend allows users to:

Connect their MetaMask wallet.
View all candidates and their current vote counts.
Cast their vote if they havenâ€™t voted yet.
We use ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract.

Hardhat Scripts
scripts/deploy.js: Contains the deployment script for deploying the smart contract to any Ethereum-compatible network.


## **Getting Started**

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
